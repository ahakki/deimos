DEIMOS
======

My very own Tumblr theme

Just copy the contents of dist/deimos.html into tumblr ^^

In the ./src folder you will find a collection of [pug](https://github.com/pugjs/pug)-templates. You can edit those, and then build them into html by running `$``npm run build`, the first time you also have to run `$``npm install`

TODOS:

- [ ]   Chat Posts
- [ ]   Mobile Optimized (Low Priority, Tumblr has a build in mobile view)
- [ ]   Support for Pages (About me, Ask ... )
- [ ]   Better Pagination
- [ ]   General cleanup
- [ ]   fix bug in watch script
